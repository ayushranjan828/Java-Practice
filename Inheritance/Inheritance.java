/*
    When we construct a new class from existing class in such a way that the new class access all the features and properties of existing class called Inheritance.

    In java extends keyword is used to perform inheritance.
    It provides code reusability.
    In can't access private members of class through inheritance.
    A sub class contains all the features of super class so, we should create the object of sub class.
    Method overriding only possible through inheritance.
